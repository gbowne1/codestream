# 📺 CodeStream (Prototype)

This is the code for a live streaming platform for programmers currently called DevStream but naming things is hard so this name is a placeholder.

CodeStream (initially named **DevStream**) is a **Full-Stack Web Application** designed as a **live streaming platform specifically for developers**.

This project currently represents a **functional Proof of Concept (PoC)** featuring a complete **Authentication system**, a **modern responsive UI with Dark Mode**, and a **mock streaming API**.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This project is fully open source and aims to be a **unique platform**, not a clone. It is actively under development.
