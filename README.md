# codestream

This is the code for a live streaming platform for programmers currently called DevStream but naming things is hard so this name is a placeholder.

It's mostly a WIP and a Proof of Concept at the moment.

It will need a lot of work to be useful and popular. It has not been hosted yet and has no backend yet.

Target Audience/Streams

- Game Developers
- Software Developers
- Operating System Developer
- Web Development
- Mobile Development
- Hacking & Cybersecurity
- Game Art & Pixel Art
- Leetcoder & Co-Working
- Talks & Conventions

possibly others...

This will be fully open source.

This is NOT a clone site
